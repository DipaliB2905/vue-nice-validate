# Validation Rules
VueNiceValidate comes with a bunch of validation rules out of the box and they are all localized and cover most validation needs:

>Target based rules like after, before, and confirmed can target custom components as well as native inputs, but the target field must have a ref attribute set and the confirmed parameter must be the same ref value. For validation providers the target field must have a vid prop set instead of the ref.
